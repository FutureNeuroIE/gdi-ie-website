                          <p>Dr. Szegezdi received her PhD in medical science in 2000 studying cell death signalling at the University of Debrecen, Hungary. She then joined the Cell Stress and Apoptosis Research laboratory led by Prof. Afshin Samali at the National University of Ireland, Galway in 2001 to study stress-induced cell death in heart and pancreatic cells. In 2010 she established her own research group as a Science Foundation Ireland Starting Investigator (SIRG) and an Irish Cancer Society Research Fellow focusing on how the tissues surrounding cancer cells protect the tumour from chemotherapeutics. She took up a university lecturer position in the Discipline of Biochemistry, National University of Ireland, Galway in 2011 where she is now a lecturer, the director of the Masters degree programme on cancer research and head of the Cancer Niche Research Laboratory and a principal investigator in the recently established Blood Cancer Network Ireland funded by SFI and the Irish Cancer Society.</p>
